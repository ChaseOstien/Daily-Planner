# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am - 5pm). The app will run in the browser and use dynamiclly updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This app is hosted live on GitHub pages under the repo https://github.com/ChaseOstien/Coding-quiz.

To use this application, simply open it in your browser and add your scheduled events to the scheduled time block. Each time block will be color coded based on past, present or future state. Once you enter your schedule events, click the save button and they will be preserved by local storage.
